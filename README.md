Reviews not only help to influence decisions of a consumer but are also an important consideration for gaining user trust.
Here we will look at reviews of board games.
The dataset has been taken from: https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers.

BoardGameGeek (BGG) is an online forum for board gaming hobbyists and a game database that holds reviews, images and videos for over 101,000 different tabletop games, including European-style board games, wargames, and card games. In addition to the game database, the site allows users to rate games on a 1â€“10 scale and publishes a ranked list of board games.

We will be using TWO models: LINEAR REGRESSOR and RANDOM FORESTS to predict the average review of a board game based on a number of characteristics such as playing time, average rating, number of players etc.
